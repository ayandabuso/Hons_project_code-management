# Hons_project_code-management
This is where i will be managing my code for my honours project.
The data used here are Mock data obtained from an imaginary reserve called Sly nature reserve.

#data collection

-pitfall traps were put on site A(-33.7523 latitude,18.4516 longitude), site B(-33.6239 latitude,18.7214
 longitude) and site C(-33.8656	 latitude,18.5429 longitude)
 
-The second pitfall traps were place 10m East from the first pitfall trap place in the co-ordinates of each site

-these pitfall traps were sorted in the Lab and recorded for every insect found. these data were recorded in an excel file.

-with the following columns:

*pitfall_id*: record pitfall number from 1-6

*site* : record which site the pitfall trap was collected.

*date*:date of collection

*taxa*: insect group recorded

*count*: number of individuals from an insect group.

#Analysis

-abundance calculation:summing the number of individuals in each taxa per site

-species richness: calculating the number of taxa groups and compareb between sites.

-visualization: looking at the overall abundance and species richness and comparing between sites
